# python_dictionary
This is a dictionary that allows you to check the characteristics of different text sources (Novel, articles, etc).
For example, it can check the words, word lengths, stem words, sentence lengths, and punctuations and therefore obtain the author's habit of writing.
It can also return a list of log similarity scores measuring the similarity of "self" and the other object and determine which source is more likely to be the text written by the desired author
